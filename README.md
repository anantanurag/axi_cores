My implementation of AXI and AXI-lite Cores


8 November 2020
ZipCPU makes some great points on using formal verfication such and eventually going on to write an efficient AXI Core. AXI is challenging, so I will start with AXI-lite. I will start with a slave AXI-lite module. I still need to read the specifications. I am not sure how this project will turn out. If I cling on to ZIPCPU's blog articles, I should sufficiently help me walk down this path for AXI-lite atleast. Once I have a decent AXI-lite core, I shall attempt the AXI core.
